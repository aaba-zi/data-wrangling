# data-wrangling
Data201 group project with R programming langauge to clean 3 datasets
The file named data201-group-project includes the jupyter notebook file and all datasets we used.

And diary, presentation powerpoint and report are shown as PDF as you can see.

We also add the link to our gitLab repo at the beginning of our group diary just in case if the code file does not work. 

Thanks for your time and have a good day!
